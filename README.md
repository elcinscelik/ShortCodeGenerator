# ShortCodeGenerator

In this project, I use php, javascript, html, css, bootstrap and xampp.
XAMPP is used as a web server software and phpMyAdmin is installed default with it.

After downloading the files from github, they need to be placed in xampp/htdocs.
MySQL admin needs to be started inside xampp client.

Then you need to create the database;
1-new
2-create database
3-database name will be esctest
Number of columns will be 5. and table name is tableone.
table has id(primary key, integer, autoIncrement), code(text), url(text), date(TimeStamp, from attributes on update current timestamp should be selected) and counter(int) columns.
Submit.

So project is ready to start.
From xampp client start apache admin.
Screenshots of the project are also included in github.
